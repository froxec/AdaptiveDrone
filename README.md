# Adaptive drone

#### REPOSITORY IS UNDER MIGRATION PROCESS. IT IS BEING MIGRATED FROM LEGACY VERSION TO SIMPLIFY THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURE.

This repository contains:
- Docker compose configuration for [Ardupilot SITL simulation with Gazebo](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-gazebo.html) (ardupilot_gazebo image)
- Automonous system based on ROS2 (autonomous_system image).

It is assumed that drone mass can change during exploatation. The goal of a control system is to adapt to these changes.

Autonomous system implements Model Predictive Control algorithm which is aided by Gaussian Process to estimate current drone mass.

## Run containers from VSCode
1. Install VSCode and with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2. While in repository working directory press Ctrl+Shift+P and run Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.

You have to do this both for ardupilot_gazebo and autonomous_system images.

## Ardupilot Software in the Loop simulation with gazebo

In ardupilot_gazebo container you have to run both ardupilot and gazebo.

### Configure environment

Firstly configure environment by running:
```
./run_entrypoint.sh
```
Then reload terminal or run:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Run ardupilot_sitl

```
sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f gazebo-iris --model JSON --map --console
```

### Run gazebo

In the 2nd terminal run:

```
gz sim -v4 -r iris_runway.sdf
```

Voil√†, simulation should be running and you should be seeing gazebo GUI with Iris quadcopter.
