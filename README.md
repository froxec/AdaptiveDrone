# Adaptive drone

#### REPOSITORY IS UNDER MIGRATION PROCESS. IT IS BEING MIGRATED FROM LEGACY VERSION TO SIMPLIFY THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURE.

This repository contains:
- Docker compose configuration for [Ardupilot SITL simulation with Gazebo](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-gazebo.html) (ardupilot_gazebo image)
- Automonous system based on ROS2 (autonomous_system image).

It is assumed that drone mass can change during exploatation. The goal of a control system is to adapt to these changes.

Autonomous system implements Model Predictive Control algorithm which is aided by Gaussian Process to estimate current drone mass.

## Run containers from VSCode
1. Install VSCode and with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
2. While in repository working directory press Ctrl+Shift+P and run Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.

You have to do this both for ardupilot_gazebo and autonomous_system images.

## Ardupilot Software in the Loop simulation with gazebo

In ardupilot_gazebo container you have to run both ardupilot and gazebo.


### Run ardupilot_sitl

```
sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f gazebo-iris --model JSON -m "--out udp:localhost:6788"
```

### Run gazebo

In the 2nd terminal run:

```
gz sim -v4 -r iris_runway.sdf
```

VoilÃ , simulation should be running and you should be seeing gazebo GUI with Iris quadcopter.

### Troubleshooting 

If gazebo doesn't find models run:

Configure environment by running:
```
./run_entrypoint.sh
```
Then reload terminal or run:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Autonomous system

In autonomous_system container run:

```
ros2 launch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=udp://:6788@127.0.0.1
```

When you look at topics list you should see /mavros/* topics.

```
ros2 topic list
```

### Interacting with ArduPilot

You can interact with Ardupilot by reading messages from /mavros topics and calling /mavros services.

Important services:
- /mavros/set_mode -> Setting quadcopter mode -> e.g. custom_mode='GUIDED'
- /mavros/cmd/arming -> arming command -> True/False

### RQT GUI

For easy gui topic/service development run RQT GUI:
```
rqt
```
